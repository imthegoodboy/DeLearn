Project Name: Massa DeAds — Decentralized Ads Hosting & Integration Platform

This platform connects two types of users:

Hoster → The person who uploads ads (advertisers)

Developer → The person who integrates ads into their website/app (publishers)

Both interact through a fully on-chain system powered by Massa’s DeWeb + Smart Contracts.

Below is the complete explanation:

⭐ WHAT DOES OUR APP DO?

Massa DeAds is a decentralized advertising platform where:

Hosters upload ads they want to display (banner ads, video ads, text ads, etc.)

Developers can browse available ads and integrate them into their websites/apps using prebuilt code snippets available in different programming languages.

Our platform acts as a bridge between hosters and developers.

In simple words:

Hosters upload ads → Developers show ads → Developers earn money automatically → All transparent & on-chain.

⭐ HOW THE APP WORKS — FULL FLOW

We have only two roles:

Hoster (Advertiser)

Developer (Publisher)

BOTH follow the same entry flow:
🔹 Step 1: Sign Up / Sign In

When a user opens the app:

Connect Massa wallet

Choose:

I am a Hoster

I am a Developer

Fill onboarding form:

Name

Email (optional)

Website (if developer)

Business name (if hoster)

Categories (Tech, AI, Crypto, Gaming, etc.)

After onboarding → redirect to their respective dashboard.
