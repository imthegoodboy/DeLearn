Think of it like:

Google Ads, but 100% on-chain

No company.
No servers.
No censorship.
No tracking hacks.

Just:

Smart contracts

DeWeb-hosted frontend

Autonomous payments

On-chain ad auctions

Transparent analytics

This is something that only Massa can do because of:

DeWeb hosting

Autonomous Smart Contracts

This will SHOCK the judges.

⭐ WHAT MASSA DeAds DOES (Simple Explanation)
✔ Anyone can become an Advertiser

They upload:

Their ad (text/image/video)

Budget

Target audience (categories)

✔ Anyone can become a Publisher

Publishers = websites or dApps that want to show ads.

They:

Connect wallet

Register their site

Embed a small JS snippet (hosted on DeWeb)

✔ ASC (Autonomous Smart Contract) handles:

Ad auction

Budget deduction

Payment autopayout

Click tracking (on-chain counters)

Fraud detection

Auto-blocking fake clicks

Scheduled payouts to publishers

No backend. No Google. Only blockchain.

⭐ EXTRA FEATURES (This makes your project BIG)
🔥 1. On-chain Pay-Per-Click System (PPC)

Advertiser sets a bid:

I pay 0.05 MASSA per click


Contract auto-deducts budget when a user clicks.

🔥 2. On-chain Impression-Based Ads (CPM)

Pay per 1000 views.

🔥 3. Fraud Prevention with Proof-of-Click

Contract verifies:

unique wallet

timestamp

IP-hash

no repeated spam

ASC automatically bans suspicious activity.

🔥 4. Reputation Score for Publishers

Publishers earn:

higher score if clicks are genuine

lower score if click fraud detected

High-score publishers get better-paying ads.

🔥 5. AutoPayout Every Day

ASC schedules:

Every 24 hours → send payout to publisher


No one needs to manually withdraw.

🔥 6. Ad NFT Marketplace

Each ad campaign = NFT representing:

budget

targeting rules

remaining balance

Advertisers can sell ads to other advertisers.

Unique idea!

Deducts budget automatically

🔹 Step 5: View Analytics

⭐ HOW IT WORKS — USER POV (Publisher)
🔹 Step 1: Register as Publisher

Connect wallet

Add your website link

Describe categories

🔹 Step 2: Get a Script Snippet

Example:

<script src="https://deads.massa/snippet.js"></script>


This script:

Calls Massa node

Gets best ad

Displays it on page

🔹 Step 3: Show Ads Automatically

ASC:

Matches ads to your site category

Sends impressions

Sends clicks

🔹 Step 4: Get Paid Daily

ASC runs:

Schedule -> every 24h -> pay publisher earnings


Automatic.
Zero friction.

⭐ HOW IT WORKS — SYSTEM POV (Smart Contract Logic)
🔹 Contract Stores:

advertiser budgets

publisher reputation

ads metadata

ad categories

bids

impression count

click count

scheduled payouts

🔹 When Ad is Loaded (View)

Action:

function recordImpression(adId, publisher)


ASC:

increases impression counter

publishes event

🔹 When User Clicks
function recordClick(adId, publisher, userHash)


ASC checks:

If userHash clicked recently → fraud

If not → valid click

Deducts advertiser balance:

adBudget -= bidPrice
publisherEarnings += bidPrice

🔹 Daily Payout

ASC triggers automatically:

for each publisher:
    transfer(publisher, earnings)
    reset earnings

🔹 Ad Auction Algorithm (Simple Version)

When an ad spot is requested:

Filter ads by category

Sort by bid price

Pick highest bidder

Check that:

ad has budget

advertiser not banned

Return the ad to publisher JS snippet

This is like a decentralized Google Ads auction.

This platform connects two types of users:

Hoster → The person who uploads ads (advertisers)

Developer → The person who integrates ads into their website/app (publishers)

Both interact through a fully on-chain system powered by Massa’s DeWeb + Smart Contracts.

Below is the complete explanation:

⭐ WHAT DOES OUR APP DO?

Massa DeAds is a decentralized advertising platform where:

Hosters upload ads they want to display (banner ads, video ads, text ads, etc.)

Developers can browse available ads and integrate them into their websites/apps using prebuilt code snippets available in different programming languages.

Our platform acts as a bridge between hosters and developers.

In simple words:

Hosters upload ads → Developers show ads → Developers earn money automatically → All transparent & on-chain.

⭐ HOW THE APP WORKS — FULL FLOW

We have only two roles:

Hoster (Advertiser)

Developer (Publisher)

BOTH follow the same entry flow:
🔹 Step 1: Sign Up / Sign In

When a user opens the app:

Connect Massa wallet

Choose:

I am a Hoster

I am a Developer

Fill onboarding form:

Name

Email (optional)

Website (if developer)

Business name (if hoster)

Categories (Tech, AI, Crypto, Gaming, etc.)

After onboarding → redirect to their respective dashboard.
